### Brief background
I am an MS Bioinformatics student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My previous education was a BS in Psychology where I also took pre-medical coursework and statistics. Currently I am working as a research assistant to optimize a ChIP-seq histone analysis pipeline. I aim to learn more about clinical genomics and assist in providing more efficient healthcare delivery. 

Hobby interests include photography, city biking, and live music.
