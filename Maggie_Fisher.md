# About Me
I am a MS Bioinformatics student in Dr. Greg Gibson's lab. My research involves fine mapping eQTLs
assosiated with autoimmune disease using a novel conditional analysis approach. Prior to attending
Georgia Tech I graduated from Texas A&M University with a BS in Biology and worked fulltime as a
genetics laboratory technician. I love Atlanta, despite missing Texas BBQ and good salsa.
