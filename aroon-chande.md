## About me

I TA this class

I am a Bioinformatics Scientist with the [Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory](http://abil.ihrc.com), better known as ABiL, and a Ph.D. student in [King Jordan's lab at Georgia Tech](http://jordan.biology.gatech.edu/page/).  I graduated with an Msc Bioinformatics from GaTech in 2016, and I've been in the computational biology field now for almost 7 years now.  I started out as a protein biochemist and structural biologist, then moved into human pathogens and infectious diseases.  As of late I do a lot of human genetics work for my Ph.D. through the [ChocoGen project](https://www.chocogen.com/) and a lot of microbial and microbiome work with ABiL.

I'm passionate about developing new tools, techniques and methods for bioinformatics.  I have a strange love for making custom databases for large scale analyses....even if its not required.


## Some of my projects here at GaTech

1.  StringMLST:
	[Code](https://github.com/jordanlab/stringMLST)  |  [Reference](http://jordan.biology.gatech.edu/page/software/stringmlst/)  |	[Paper](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/06/bioinformatics.btw586.full.pdf+html)
	Fast k-mer based tool for multi locus sequence typing (MLST). stringMLST is a tool for detecting the MLST of an isolate directly from the genome sequencing reads. stringMLST predicts the ST of an isolate in a completely assembly and alignment free manner. The tool is designed in a light-weight, platform-independent fashion with minimum dependencies.

2.  Global Distribution of Genetic Traits server
    [Website](https://gadget.biosci.gatech.edu/)  [Compute Code](https://github.com/jordanlab/GADGET_compute) [Explore Code](https://github.com/jordanlab/GADGET_explore)
    Global Distribution of Genetic Traits (GADGET) is a web-based utility providing users with an intuitive tool for exploring the relationship between worldwide genetic diversity and the genomic architecture underlying a wide variety of human phenotypes (traits).

3.  Vibriocholera.com
	[Website](https://vibriocholera.com/)
	Secretion system prediction and annotation from whole genomics or prediction protein coding sequences.
