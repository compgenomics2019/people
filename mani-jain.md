## About me

I am a Masters in Bioinformatics student in the Jordan lab at the Georgia Tech. My current research focus is on the mapping of the next generation sequencing of bacterial pathogens to their Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Specifically, I am interested in bringing together and harnessing the power genomics, molecular evolution and machine learning algorithms to solve biological problem and make patient lives better.

## Skills
I am good in Python, genomics, bash, R and biology

## Groups
I am part of team 3- Genome Assembly and Comparative genomics groups
