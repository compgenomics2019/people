## About Me

I am a graduate student in my second semester of the MS Bioinformatics program here at Georgia Tech, and I work in Dr. Greg Gibson's laboratory in EBB. I'm interested in machine learning applications for different Bioinformatics problems, as well as the incorporation of Electronic Medical Records (EMR's) into these applications to improve genetic risk predictions and clinical diagnoses. 

Currently, I'm working on implementing a machine learning technique to study Crohn's disease, specifically studying the associations between disease-specific traits and variant loci and how these relationships can better help understand the mechanisms underlying the subtypes of this heterogeneous disease. 

## Skills/Experience

I typically work with Python for the majority of my work, but I've also used R, Shiny R, & BASH. I also have prior experience in MATLAB, LabVIEW, & AutoCAD.

Additionally, I have a few years of wet lab benchwork experience, but I hung up the labcoat for good (or at least for now...) in 2018 to learn more about the computational gentics research being conducted.
