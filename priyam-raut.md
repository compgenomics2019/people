I am a MS Bioinformatics student in the Georgia Institute of Technology. Currently I am working in the Lieberman Lab on identifying
biological substrates for Signal Peptide Peptidase in Archaea. My interests include *in-silico* modeling and drug design. I am 
familiar with Python, Bash, C++ and R. I like thinking. a lot.
